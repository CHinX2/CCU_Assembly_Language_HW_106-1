FROM FAIREST CREATURES WE DESIRE INCREASE,
THAT THEREBY BEAUTY'S ROSE MIGHT NEVER DIE,
BUT AS THE RIPER SHOULD BY TIME DECEASE,
HIS TENDER HEIR MIGHT BEAR HIS MEMORY:
BUT THOU CONTRACTED TO THINE OWN BRIGHT EYES,
FEED'ST THY LIGHT'S FLAME WITH SELF-SUBSTANTIAL FUEL,
MAKING A FAMINE WHERE ABUNDANCE LIES,
THY SELF THY FOE, TO THY SWEET SELF TOO CRUEL:
THOU THAT ART NOW THE WORLD'S FRESH ORNAMENT,
AND ONLY HERALD TO THE GAUDY SPRING,
WITHIN THINE OWN BUD BURIEST THY CONTENT,
AND, TENDER CHURL, MAK'ST WASTE IN NIGGARDING:
   PITY THE WORLD, OR ELSE THIS GLUTTON BE,
   TO EAT THE WORLD'S DUE, BY THE GRAVE AND THEE.

SHALL I COMPARE THEE TO A SUMMER'S DAY?
THOU ART MORE LOVELY AND MORE TEMPERATE:
ROUGH WINDS DO SHAKE THE DARLING BUDS OF MAY,
AND SUMMER'S LEASE HATH ALL TOO SHORT A DATE:
SOMETIME TOO HOT THE EYE OF HEAVEN SHINES,
AND OFTEN IS HIS GOLD COMPLEXION DIMM'D;
AND EVERY FAIR FROM FAIR SOMETIME DECLINES,
BY CHANCE OR NATURE'S CHANGING COURSE UNTRIMM'D;
BUT THY ETERNAL SUMMER SHALL NOT FADE
NOR LOSE POSSESSION OF THAT FAIR THOU OWEST;
NOR SHALL DEATH BRAG THOU WANDER'ST IN HIS SHADE,
WHEN IN ETERNAL LINES TO TIME THOU GROWEST:
   SO LONG AS MEN CAN BREATHE OR EYES CAN SEE,
   SO LONG LIVES THIS, AND THIS GIVES LIFE TO THEE.
