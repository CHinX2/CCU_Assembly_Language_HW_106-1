FROM FAIREST CREATURES WE DESIRE INCREASE,
THAT THEREBY BEAUTY'S ROSE MIGHT NEVER DIE,
BUT AS THE RIPER SHOULD BY TIME DECEASE,
HIS TENDER HEIR MIGHT BEAR HIS MEMORY:
BUT THOU CONTRACTED TO THINE OWN BRIGHT EYES,
FEED'ST THY LIGHT'S FLAME WITH SELF-SUBSTANTIAL FUEL,
MAKING A FAMINE WHERE ABUNDANCE LIES,
THY SELF THY FOE, TO THY SWEET SELF TOO CRUEL:
THOU THAT ART NOW THE WORLD'S FRESH ORNAMENT,
AND ONLY HERALD TO THE GAUDY SPRING,
WITHIN THINE OWN BUD BURIEST THY CONTENT,
AND, TENDER CHURL, MAK'ST WASTE IN NIGGARDING:
   PITY THE WORLD, OR ELSE THIS GLUTTON BE,
   TO EAT THE WORLD'S DUE, BY THE GRAVE AND THEE.
